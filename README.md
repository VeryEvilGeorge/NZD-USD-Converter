# NZD-USD-Converter
Converts NZD to USD and back in an entire column in Excel, with updated exchange rates.

Run NZD_USD_Converter.py to open the applet, paste source and destination file paths for excel sheets. If you want to edit the same excel sheet, paste the source into both.

This is also a rudimentary example of full stack development.
